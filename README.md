# txstreet-deploy

This repo will eventually contain all the tools and instructions necessary to
self-host an instance of [TxStreet][txstreet] ([open-source][txstreet-source])
anywhere.

## Status

Work in progress.

I will be committing experimental tools, config and instructions as I'm making
progress.

Updates will be posted in the [progress report issue][progress-report-issue].

## Objectives

* Fully functional

* Dockerized services

* As little assumptions about the deployment environment as possible

* Sample `docker-compose.yml` of a full instance

  * Including blockchain nodes

## Credits

Thanks to [@tomx-eth] for making such a neat blockchain visualizer, publishing its
source, writing comprehensive docs, and passing the torch to the community on
the Litecoin Telegram.
